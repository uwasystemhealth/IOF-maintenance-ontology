# maintenance-ontology
This is a place to store versions of the Maintenance WG Ontology

At the IOF meeting 4/12/19 a new file was created maintenance_wg_ontology_iofcore.owl file. This file only imports iofcore which is from https://github.com/NCOR-US/IOF-BFO. The previous imports were removed. We suggest you use this *maintenance_wg_ontology_iofcore.owl* moving forward

Prior to the IOF meeting 4/12/19 the file was maintenance_wg_ontology.owl file. This file imported ROImport.owl, bfo.owl. This file is still here as a reference.

Update December 2019:
Since the update of the IOF ontology available at https://github.com/NCOR-US/IOF-BFO in December 2019. We completed a major overhaul of the ontology by the maintenance working group. This work has also been submitted to the I-ESA 2020 conference.
