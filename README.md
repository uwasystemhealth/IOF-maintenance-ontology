# The IOF Maintenance Working Group

The [__Industrial Ontology Foundry__](https://www.industrialontologies.org/) is a group working to co-create a set of open reference ontologies for the manufacturing and engineering domains. The [__IOF Maintenance Working Group__](https://www.industrialontologies.org/maintenance-wg/) is working on a __reference ontology__ for industrial maintenance using a __top-down ontology engineering approach__. Further ongoing work within the Maintenance Working Group includes the development of __domain ontologies__ including a __failure modes and effects analysis ontology__ and a __maintenance procedure ontology__.

Please note that the current version of the maintenance working group reference ontology has not yet been approved by the IOF Leadership Team.

### The Maintenance Working Group in the Context of the IOF Ontologies

The Maintenance Working Group Reference Ontology directly imports the __IOF Core__ reference ontology (developed by the [IOF Top-Down working group](https://www.industrialontologies.org/top-down-wg/)). Figure 1 shows where ontologies developed by the Maintenance Working Group fit into the broader context of the IOF ontologies. More information about the modularisation choices made by the IOF can be found on our [website](https://www.industrialontologies.org/iof-charter).

### How to work with the maintenance ontology

To view the Maintenance Wokring Group Reference Ontology, you may want to use an Ontology Development Environment (ODE) such as Protege (https://protege.stanford.edu/). Please ensure that an ODE is installed before going further.

To open the maintenance WG ontology, perform the following steps:
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Navigate to the folder named *Reference Ontology - Maintenance Working Group*
3. Right click the file named *maintenance_wg_ontology_iofcore.owl*, click "Open With" and choose "Protege".
4. Protege might prompt you to manually find some files that the ontology imports. All relevant files can be found in the *imports* folder.

Once the Maintenance Working Group ontology is opened, you will see that the terms created by the Maintenance WG are highligted in bold under the "Classes" tab. By clicking on one of these terms, you will be able to view the definitions for these terms that were created b the maintenance WG.

Please note that this ontology is a work in progress and not all axioms have been included in the file. However, if you do wish to run a reasoner over the ontology. You can do so in Protege by clicking "Start Reasoner". 

### Additional Resources in the Repository

This repository also includes the following:

- __Documents & Resources:__ This folder contains any working documents and additional information about the IOF Maintenance Working Group Ontology
- __Domain Ontologies & Use Cases:__ This folder contains the current state of the domain ontologies created by members of the IOF Working Group
- __Publications (Maintenance WG Authors)__: This folder contains details of relevant past publications from members of the IOF Maintenance Working Group
