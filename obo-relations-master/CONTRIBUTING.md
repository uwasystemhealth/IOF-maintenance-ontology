## Contributing via Pull Requests

We hope to be able to accept contributions to the ontology in the form of Pull Requests in the future. Note that this is currently difficult for OWL, see:

OWLAPI developers are working to circumvent this. In the interim, PRs can only be accepted if you have a LOCK on the editors file. See [src/ontology/README-editors.md](src/ontology/README-editors.md) for details.
