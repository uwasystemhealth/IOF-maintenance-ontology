How to work with the maintenance ontology
To view the Maintenance Wokring Group Reference Ontology, you may want to use an Ontology Development Environment (ODE) such as Protege (https://protege.stanford.edu/). Please ensure that an ODE is installed before going further.

To open the maintenance WG ontology, perform the following steps:

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Navigate to the folder named Reference Ontology - Maintenance Working Group
3. Right click the file named maintenance_wg_ontology_iofcore.owl, click "Open With" and choose "Protege".
4. Protege might prompt you to manually find some files that the ontology imports. All relevant files can be found in the imports folder.

Once the Maintenance Working Group ontology is opened, you will see that the terms created by the Maintenance WG are highligted in bold under the "Classes" tab. By clicking on one of these terms, you will be able to view the definitions for these terms that were created b the maintenance WG.

Please note that this ontology is a work in progress and not all axioms have been included in the file. However, if you do wish to run a reasoner over the ontology. You can do so in Protege by clicking "Start Reasoner".
