Main visible changes in this version:
- Issue #187: ETL class
- Issue #183: proposed extensions to IAO:'document part' and IAO:'textual entity

Under the hood:
- Imports refreshed 2017-01-06
- A new release process reduces work required to push out new releases
-- All dependents now versioned, so  http://purl.obolibrary.org/iao/2017-01-06/iao-stated.owl should always load the same files
-- This entailed making copies of ro/core.owl and its imports ro/bfo-axioms.owl and ro/anotations.owl which did not have versioned PURLs
-- Now: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/iao/2017-01-06/ro/core.owl, etc.
-- Copies were downloaded 2017-01-06
- BFO version http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/bfo/2.0/bfo.owl
- Stopped using protege-dc instead adding declarations for those properties to ontology-metadata.owl
- files no longer used deleted from repo
- Consistent use of versionIRI for our files - /dev/ is versionIRI, not ontologyIRI
- purl.obolibrary.org config cleaned up
