### Current Work

##### An ontology for maintenance procedure documentation
__Authors__: Caitlin Woods, Tyler Bikaun, Tim French, Melinda Hodkiewicz

__Abstract__: Procedures are an integral part of safe work practices across many industries including aerospace, mining and manufacturing. In many organisations, procedure documentation is non-uniform and exist as PDFs. This makes it difficult to create machine-readable interpretations and integrate information, such as asset health information, from other systems. The aim of this work is to align procedure information that originates from disparate non-uniform data sources. To do this, we developed an ontology for maintenance procedures using the OWL 2 description language. The ontology is tested using a series of competency questions. For each competency question, queries are demonstrated using SPARQL. This work enables organisations to store their procedure data in a uniform format, enabling increased integration between systems. We anticipate that this work will save industry time and resources in planning and scheduling maintenance work.

##### A specification for named entity recognition of industrial maintenance texts through goal driven knowledge elicitation
__Authors__: Tyler Bikaun, Melinda Hodkiewicz, Wei Liu, Tim French and Michael Stuart

__Abstract__: Much valuable information is captured in the unstructured text fields of maintenance work orders. Currently, maintenance and reliability engineers must spend considerable time locating, reading and interpreting these fields to extract information to understand the failures and work done on their equipment. To overcome the laborious nature of this task, machine readability of text is crucial. Machine readable text enables the use of statistical and machine learning algorithms that have the potential for automated, standardised and scalable knowledge liberation. A core challenge of maintenance text machine readability is the absence of a suitable named entity specification that widely captures domain specific phenomena such as equipment failure causality and maintenance activity execution. To overcome this, we propose and evaluate a novel specification for consistent mark-up of unstructured maintenance texts. Our specification is developed through a top-down bottom-up approach using the model-annotate-model-annotate cycle, resulting in 13 named entities which broadly capture phenomena in industrial maintenance. The utility of this specification is demonstrated through the application of named entity recognition on three different industrial maintenance datasets, where its expressiveness for a broad range of semantic and syntactic contexts is exhibited. Through this, it is shown that the proposed specification is well suited for identifying information that can support diagnostics, root cause analysis, reliability parameter estimation and work order prioritisation.
